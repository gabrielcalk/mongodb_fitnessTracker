## *Description*
The purpose of this project is to offer an interface in which the user can add their cardio and resistance training and be able to access and view them whenever they want. It is noteworthy that the visualization of training will be performed through a graph developed using the chart.js application.

In this application the following technologies were used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB and Heroku. The main difficulty during the development of this application was precisely understanding how I could reference the same workout so that the user could create several exercises within a complete workout.
